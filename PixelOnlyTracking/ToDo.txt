Pixel stand-alone tracking and vertexing


- Improvements to the code:
	- Tk: Eta distributions with relative numbers (not absolute value)


- Understand:
	- Vx: Vedere compatibilita` Data / MC / MC-Truth

	- Tk: Explain Purity vs pt
	- Tk: Make efficiency more similar Data-Simulation
	- Tk: Explain pt pulls cut in the distribution at high pt
	- Tk: Explain d0 pulls AND d0 resolution at high eta
	- Tk: Explain dz pulls AND dz resolution at high pt and eta

	- Why tracks with pt < 0.5 have strange behaviour
	- Make new pixel-track fitter with > 3 hits


For what concerns QCD, this is what we've been asked at the PixelOfflineSoftware:

"In your last talk at pixel offline you showed the pixel
track fake rate. I think it would be interesting to see these
effects in high Pt jet samples. There are QCD relval
MC sample with different jet momenta that you could run on.

We plan to use pixel triples to get track angles (before full
tracking is performed) needed for splitting merged clusters
in dense jets and it would be interesting to know
how many times the angles would be wrong because the pixel track
is fake. It would also be very intersting to know the fake rate
for lower quality pixel tracks (fewer matching hits).

The samples I have in mind are:
RelValQCD_Pt_15_20
RelValQCD_Pt_20_30
RelValQCD_Pt_30_50
RelValQCD_Pt_50_80
RelValQCD_Pt_80_120
RelValQCD_Pt_120_170
RelValQCD_Pt_170_230
...
RelValQCD_Pt_3000_3500
For example:

For example, pick a low pt-hat sample (like RelValQCD_Pt_15_20)
and compare it with a medium one (RelValQCD_Pt_170_230) and
a high one (RelValQCD_Pt_3000_3500)."
